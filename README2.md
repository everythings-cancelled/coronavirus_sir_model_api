## Coronavirus SIR Model API
This is an API that builds a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model from Coronavirus Data.

The SIR model is one of the simplest compartmental models, and many models are derivations of this basic form.  The model consists of three compartments: S for the number of susceptible people in a population, I for the number of infectious people in a population, and R for the number resillient people (either dead or recovered in a population).  This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases which are transmitted from human to human.

To represent that the number of susceptible, infected and resillient individuals may vary over time (even if the total population size remains constant), we make the precise numbers a function of t (time): S(t), I(t) and R(t).
